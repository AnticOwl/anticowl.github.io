Smash skeletons, defeat dragons, and battle giant golems in Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot Adventure. Experience the acclaimed 2013 quest that started it all in this standalone campaign jam-packed with fantasy, fun, and mountains of magical loot

## Required
* [Willow Mod Manager](https://github.com/bl-sdk/willow-mod-manager)
* [Photo Mode](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/blob/master/Photomode/Photomode.zip)

## Optional
* Reshade 
* [Uber Post Processing](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/blob/master/UberPostProcessing/UberPostProcessing.zip)
* [BL2 Eternal](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/blob/master/BL2Eternal/BL2Eternal.zip)

## How to Download
Sounds funny, isn't it. But everything you need is hosted on GitHub. And, it's not the most friendly place.
So, for the [Willow Mod Manager](https://github.com/bl-sdk/willow-mod-manager) click on `Releases` then scroll a bit down and click on `PythonSDK.zip
`. That's all you have to do here.
Now, for the [Photo Mode](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/blob/master/Photomode/Photomode.zip), click on the `...` then `Download`. Same for the 2 other optional mods that I recommend.

## Installation
### Loader Installation
Now that you have downloaded the required files, it's time to install the Mod Manager and the Photo Mode. 
First off, open the PythonSDK.zip and drag the content as is in your game root directory `\steamapps\common\Pawpaw`. Or, you can follow this little video to know how to do it.

### Mods Installation
Once the loader is installed, it's time to add some mods. Let's start with the Photo Mode one. Open the zip file you previously downloaded and extract the content to `\Pawpaw\Binaries\Win32\Mods` You should end up with something like that after having extracted the mods you need.

## How To
### Enable/Disable Mods
Once everything is installed, start the game and head to `Mods` from the main menu. Select the mod you want to enable or disable.
Press `A` on your controller or `Enter` on keyboard.

### Configure Mods Keybinds
Head to `Options` then `Keyboard and Mouse` and finally `Modded Key Bindings` to change the keyboard bindings if needed. Most chance you won't have to do it.

### Photo Mode
Not like in Borderlands 3 or any other game. Here straight forward. Press `P` to enable or disable it.

### Uber Processing
This one looks only to be accessible from the `Mods` menu via `Options`. Be aware that each map has his own post process. So, if you want to do your own, the `Post Process Volume` needs to be `Off`. Then you can start doing yours.

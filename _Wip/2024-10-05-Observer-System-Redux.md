The year is 2084. In a dark cyberpunk world shattered by plagues and wars, become a neural police detective and hack into the jagged minds of others. Make use of anything they felt, thought, or remembered to solve the case and catch the elusive killer.

## Required
* [UUU v3/v4](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm)

## Optional
* Reshade

If you, like me, ALT-TAB a lot, I would recommend changing `anshar.PauseGameOnUnfocused` from `1` to `0`. This expecially if you are using lights or post process in UUU v4.x.

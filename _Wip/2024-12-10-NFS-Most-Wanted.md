The open-world action in Need for Speed Most Wanted gives you the freedom to drive your way. Hit jumps and shortcuts, switch cars, lie low or head for terrain that plays to your vehicle’s unique strengths. 
Fight your way past cops and rivals using skill, high-end car tech and tons of nitrous.

## Required
* [ToCa Edit 4.0.2](https://mega.nz/folder/iORliCIK#53Vv--UOAR77w6yXlihD-A/file/uSAHjIjR) (Download nfsmwrp40.zip)
* [NFSHD (2012) HD Effects by Aero](https://nfsmods.xyz/mod/2694)

## Optional
* [ReShade](https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_6.3.3_Addon.exe)

## Pre-Requisite
* EA App Overlay must be disabled (check ot because it can be magically re-activated).

## Installation

### ToCa Edit 4.0.2
Quite simple and straight forward. 
* Open the previous downloaded zip
* Extract `Remote Injection` somwhere on your disk
* Done

### NFSHD (2012) HD Effects by Aero
Also one of the simpliest thing to do
* Extract the content into your game folder (\Need for Speed(TM) Most Wanted). Where `NSF13.exe` reside.
* Done

## Configuration
For the HD Effects, read what the mod does. I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. 
So, to configure it, go to your game installation folder then in `scripts`. Ususally like `E:\Games\Need for Speed(TM) Most Wanted\scripts`.
Open the file called `NFSMW2012HDEffects.ini` with a text editor. You will notice that for every setting there is an explanation. 
For me, the most interesting sections are [RESOLUTION], [VIEW DISTANCE] and [GENERAL]. 
If you have a GPU that is at least an NVIDIA Serie 2K or 8GB, you can set the [RESOLUTION] and [VIEW DISTANCE] at max.
For the [RESOLUTION] section, set the `HighShadowRefreshRate = 0` to `HighShadowRefreshRate = 1` and `SetReflectionShadow = 0` to `SetReflectionShadow = 1`.
Change `MotionBlurStrength = 5.0` to `MotionBlurStrength = 2.5`. At 5.0 it's already a bit high.

{% include note.html content="Changing `CinematicMode = 1` to `CinematicMode = 2` will automatically enable the Super Sampling at 4X. This can kill your FPS."%}

Hell is an experiment you can't survive in Outlast, a first-person survival horror game developed by veterans of some of the biggest game franchises in history. As investigative journalist Miles Upshur, explore Mount Massive Asylum and try to survive long enough to discover its terrible secret... if you dare.

## Required
* Outlast cheat table
* [Cheat Engine 7.5 or higher](https://du0wcodktyky8.cloudfront.net/installer/003333/420362877561915)

## Optional
* [Film Grain Removal by Wastelander 121](https://www.nexusmods.com/outlast/mods/65?tab=posts)
* [Reshade 6.x](https://reshade.me)

## Configuration
### Game Pause Configuration
In `Documents\My Games\Outlast\OLGame\Config`, open `OLInput.ini` and at the end of the file, just before  `[IniVersion]`, add this line 
`Bindings=(Name="F12",Command="PAUSE",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)`. 

### Resolution at or Above 4K
In `\Documents\My Games\Outlast\OLGame\Config`, open `OLEngine.ini` and add or modify the lines below under `[Engine.Engine]`

```
bUseCustomResolution=true ; -- Uncomment this and set CustomResX and CustomResY below to use a non-standard resolution
CustomResX=3840
CustomResY=2160
```
This will allow you to set the game at higher than the max allowed of 1440p.

### Film Grain Removal or Modification
2 choices here: full removal or in game modification.
#### Full Removal
From the link above, carefully read the description as you will need TFC Installer. So, download the mod **AND** TFC Installer.
Extract both files somewhere. Start TFC Installer, point to your Outlast installation and install the mod.

Once done, the film grain should be removed (normal mode and night vision).

#### Grain modification
In the cheat table, there are 2 parts for the grain. The first part is reset after the use of the camera while the second part is like the default for the game.
I would recommend configuring the second part first and use the camera to apply it to the game.

Hell is an experiment you can't survive in Outlast, a first-person survival horror game developed by veterans of some of the biggest game franchises in history. As investigative journalist Miles Upshur, explore Mount Massive Asylum and try to survive long enough to discover its terrible secret... if you dare.

## Required
* Outlast cheat table
* [Cheat Engine 7.5 or higher](https://du0wcodktyky8.cloudfront.net/installer/003333/420362877561915)

## Optional
* [Film Grain Removal by Wastelander 121](https://www.nexusmods.com/outlast/mods/65?tab=posts)
* [Reshade 6.x](https://reshade.me)

## Configuration
### Game Pause Configuration
In `Documents\My Games\Outlast\OLGame\Config`, open `OLInput.ini` and at the end of the file, just before  `[IniVersion]`, add this line 
`Bindings=(Name="F12",Command="PAUSE",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)`. 

### Resolution at or above 4K
In `\Documents\My Games\Outlast\OLGame\Config`, open `OLEngine.ini` and add or modify the lines below under `[Engine.Engine]`

```
bUseCustomResolution=true ; -- Uncomment this and set CustomResX and CustomResY below to use a non-standard resolution
CustomResX=3840
CustomResY=2160
```
This will allow you to set the game at higher than the max allowed of 1440p.

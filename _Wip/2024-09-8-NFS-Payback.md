Set in the underworld of Fortune Valley, you and your crew were divided by betrayal and reunited by revenge to take down The House, a nefarious cartel that rules the city’s casinos, criminals and cops. In this corrupt gambler’s paradise, the stakes are high and The House always wins.

## Required
* [Hatti NFS Payback Camera Tools](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xuwjz99rdgn72ys/CT_NFS17_20180620.rar/file)
* [ReShade 6.x](https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_6.2.0_Addon.exe)
* [Cheat Enhgine 7.x](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php)

## How to Use
Start the game and resume where you left. Once the map is loaded, launch `NFS Payback Cinematic Tools.exe`. You will get an error saying `Unable to check for updates.`. 
Just click OK and it will continue to load. A console window will popup and after everything is loaded the GUI should be visible in game. 
For better shadows change the default value (1600) to something like `3072` or `4096`.

## Required
* [IDK31 EXCELLENT Camera Cheat Table](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662482735)
* [Cheat Egnine](https://www.cheatengine.org/)

## Optional
* Reshade 4.9.1 (versions above will probably give you problems when ALT-Tabbing).
* [Nilin Regular Outfit](https://www.nexusmods.com/rememberme/mods/5)
* [Nilin Intro Outfit](https://www.nexusmods.com/rememberme/mods/1)
* [Enhanced Lighting Modification](https://www.nexusmods.com/rememberme/mods/12)
* [Better Graphics](https://www.nexusmods.com/rememberme/mods/24) 
* [TexMod Autoload](https://www.nexusmods.com/rememberme/mods/4?tab=files) (very optional)

## Installation
If you go for the optional items, and once downloaded, extract the 2 texture mods in your installation folder (.\steamapps\common\Remember Me\Binaries\Win32).
Each time you want to play and/or take some shots you will have to start `texmode.exe` and choose the texture mods and game exe like int the print below.

You can also use `TexMod Autoload` if you feel confortable writing the ini file yourself.

Now, for the `Enhanced Lighting Modification` and `Better Graphices` you will need to extract the first one in `C:\Users\<YOUR USERNAME>\Documents\My Games\UnrealEngine3\RememberMeGame\Config`.
But, before that, be sure you backup these files first! The file residing in `Colour & Lighting` needs to be extracted in the same folder as the 2 previous texture mods.
For the `Better Graphics`, you can safely overwrite the file. But, I would backup it and test as it could introduce shadow banding in some cases.

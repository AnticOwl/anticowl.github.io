What about you and your team are sent in recognition and end up in the most messed up situation possible. This, in a now destroyed Dubai where sand storms are becoming typical.

## Required
* [Willow Mod Manager](https://github.com/bl-sdk/willow-mod-manager)
* [Photo Mode](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/blob/master/Photomode/Photomode.zip)

## Optional
* Reshade 
* [Uber Post Processing](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/blob/master/UberPostProcessing/UberPostProcessing.zip)
* [BL2 Eternal](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/blob/master/BL2Eternal/BL2Eternal.zip) 

## How to Download
Sounds funny, isn't it. But everything you need is hosted on GitHub. And, it's not the most friendly place.
So, for the [Willow Mod Manager](https://github.com/bl-sdk/willow-mod-manager) click on `Releases` then scroll a bit down and click on `PythonSDK.zip
`. That's all you have to do here.
Now, for the [Photo Mode](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/blob/master/Photomode/Photomode.zip), click on the `...` then `Download`. Same for the 2 other optional mods that I recommend.

## Installation
Now that you have downloaded the required files, it's time to install the Mod Manager and the Photo Mode. 
First off, open the PythonSDK.zip and drag the content as is in your game root directory `\steamapps\common\Borderlands 2`. Or, you can follow this little video to know how to do it.

Played CONTROL at release, replayed it on PC a few years after. Replayed it again for some shots. Was dragged back in it a few months ago.
Nothing to say. You can't escape Jessie!

## REQUIRED
Nothing! 

## Optional
* [Loose File Loader by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/11)
* [Tweakables by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/14)
* [Photo Mode Range Unlocked by iLikeDetectives](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/23)
* [Dev Menu by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/28)

## Installation

First of all, unzip the Loose File Loader in your game directory, just where control.exe resides.
Once done, unzip the Tweakables files and place it in `data\globaldb\`. I recommend reading the description on Nexus as it has a lot of useful informations.
The one you absolutely want is the PHoto Mode range unlocker. Again, read the discription on Nexus for the full installation. Here, you would go for scenario 2.
Finally extract DevMenu.dll and DevMenu.ini in the pluging directory. If it doesn't exists, create it and put these 2 files in it.

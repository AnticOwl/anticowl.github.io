Played CONTROL at release on console, replayed it on PC a few years after. Replayed it again for some shots. Dragged back in it a few months ago.
Nothing to say. No, you cannot escape Jessie!

## Required
* [Loose File Loader by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/11)
* [Photo Mode Range Unlocked by iLikeDetectives](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/23)

## Optional (but really recommended, trust me!)
* [Tweakables by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/14)
* [Dev Menu by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/28)
* ReShade

## Installation

First of all, unzip the Loose File Loader in your game directory, just where control.exe resides. Once done, unzip the Tweakables files and place it in `data\globaldb\`. 
I recommend reading the description on Nexus as it has a lot of useful information. The one you absolutely want is the Photo Mode range unlocker. 
Again, read the description on Nexus for the full installation procedure. As you have just installed the Tweakables files, you would go for scenario 2 here. 
Finally extract `DevMenu.dll` and `DevMenu.ini` in the plugins directory. If it doesn’t exist, create it and put these 2 files in it.

## Dev Menu Options
<div style="width:65%; margin: auto;">

### Ambiance System
This section allows you to change the actual LUT (Look-Up-Table), or basically color grading, of the actual scene.
There are many different ones that could serve you as a start for your shot. 

### Tweakables - Character Lighting
A great thing in the dev menu is that it allows you to use the “Character Lights”. There are 3 spots named CharacterLight0, 1and 2 available and ready for use. To do this, first enter the photo mode and position the camera as you wish. Hide the HUD and open to the dev menu by pressing F11. Navigate to Tweakables menu and scroll down to CharacterLight0. Click on it and start raising the intensity a bit so you can see where your light is. Use the offsets to place your light. If you want some colours, just move the Color sliders; Color0, 1 and 2 are red, green and blue respectively.

Once done and your shot saved, click on `Load Panel State` to revert to default again.

Below a small example with 3 lights.

### Render Options
This section is one that requires a bit of trial and error as it is best to play with each checkbox to see what the options do. In general, there are 3 options that I like to activate. To know: Render SSDiffuse, Force Dynamic, and Cinematic Mode.

In certain places, activating these settings will give quite a different look to the scene, making it a bit more dramatic or mysterious.

Example with these 3 options checked.

</img-comparison-slider>

### Parameters
Again, this section is a playground, in fact, it’s **YOUR** playground! There are many options that can be tweaked for the sake of a great shot. To know: Ambient, Atmosphere, Bloom, Exposure, Global Illumination (GI), Post Process, and Tone Map. I won’t enumerate everything that is in this section and instead will let you discover it by yourself. It’s play and discovery time for you!

As an example though, here are some details about the before and after for the shot below.


- Parameters
    -  Bloom
        - Blur Scale 0 lowered around 0.19
        - Burn Intensity, Threshold and Scatter raised

    - Post Process
        - Highlights and Shadows Color Balance modified
        - Levels Max and Min changed
        - Radial Blur and Vignette modified
- Tweakables
    - Character Lights 0 to 2 changed

There is no way to reload the default. If you change anything in the tweakables and want to reset, click on Load Panel State to revert to the defaults."%}

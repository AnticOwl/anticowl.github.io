Played CONTROL at release, replayed it on PC a few years after. Replayed it again for some shots. Was dragged back in it a few months ago.
Nothing to say. No, you cannot escape Jessie!

## Required
Nothing! 

## Optional
* [Loose File Loader by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/11)
* [Tweakables by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/14)
* [Photo Mode Range Unlocked by iLikeDetectives](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/23)
* [Dev Menu by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/28)

## Installation

First of all, unzip the Loose File Loader in your game directory, just where control.exe resides.
Once done, unzip the Tweakables files and place it in `data\globaldb\`. I recommend reading the description on Nexus as it has a lot of useful informations.
The one you absolutely want is the Photo Mode range unlocker. Again, read the discription on Nexus for the full installation. Here, you would go for scenario 2.
Finally extract DevMenu.dll and DevMenu.ini in the plugins directory. If it doesn't exists, create it and put these 2 files in it.

## Dev Menu Options

### Characther Lighting
Great thing in the dev menu is that you can use the Character Lights. There are 3 spots named CharacterLight0,1 and 2 available and ready to for use. 
For this, open to the dev menu by pressing F11. Navigate to menu 5/15 (Tweakables) and scroll down to CharacterLight0. Click on it and start raising the intensity a bit so you can see where your light is. Use the offsets to place your light. If you want some colours, just move the sliders. Color0, 1 and 2 are respectively red green and blue.

{% include note.html content="The lights are tied to the camera position. Moving it will also move the lights."%}

Below a small example with 3 lights.

Played CONTROL at release on console, replayed it on PC a few years after. Replayed it again for some shots. Dragged back in it a few months ago.
Nothing to say. No, you cannot escape Jessie!

## Required
* [Loose File Loader by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/11)
* [Photo Mode Range Unlocked by iLikeDetectives](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/23)

## Optional
* [Tweakables by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/14)
* [Dev Menu by Reg2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/control/mods/28)

## Installation

First of all, unzip the Loose File Loader in your game directory, just where control.exe resides.
Once done, unzip the Tweakables files and place it in `data\globaldb\`. I recommend reading the description on Nexus as it has a lot of useful informations.
The one you absolutely want is the Photo Mode range unlocker. Again, read the discription on Nexus for the full installation. Here, you would go for scenario 2.
Finally extract DevMenu.dll and DevMenu.ini in the plugins directory. If it doesn't exists, create it and put these 2 files in it.

## Dev Menu Options

### Dev Menu Controls

    overflow: auto;

    width: 100%;

### Ambiance System
This section allows you to change the actual LUT (Look-Up-Table or basically color grading) of the actual scene.
There are many different ones that could serve you as a start for your shot. 

### Tweakables - Character Lighting
Great thing in the dev menu is that you can use the Character Lights. There are 3 spots named CharacterLight0,1 and 2 available and ready for use. 
For this, enter the photo mode and position the camera as you wish. Hide the HUD and open to the dev menu by pressing F11. Navigate to menu 5/15 (Tweakables) and scroll down to CharacterLight0. Click on it and start raising the intensity a bit so you can see where your light is. Use the offsets to place your light. If you want some colours, just move the sliders. Color0, 1 and 2 are respectively red, green and blue.

Once done and your shot saved, click on `Load Panel State` to revert to default again.

{% include note.html content="The lights are tied to the camera position. Moving it will also move the lights."%}

Below a small example with 3 lights.

</img-comparison-slider>

### Render Options
This section, is a bit of a "check by yourself" one. Play with the checkbox to see what option do what. Still, there are 3 options I like to activate.
To know: Render SSDiffuse, Force Dynamic and Cinematic Mode.

In certain places, when you activate these settings, will give another look to the scene. Making it a bit more dramatic or mysterious.

Example with these 3 options checked.

### Parameters
Again, this section is a playground. in fact, it's **YOUR** playground! there are many options that can be tweaked for the sake of a great shot. 
To know: Ambient, Atmosphere, Bloom, Exposure, Global Illumination (GI), Post Process and Tone Map.

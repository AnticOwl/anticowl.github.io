In a city where information is heavily monitored, couriers called Runners transport sensitive data. In this seemingly utopian paradise, a crime has been committed, and you are being hunted. 
You are a Runner called Faith and this innovative first-person action-adventure is your story.

## Required
* Mirror's Edge Free Camera by IDK31
* [Mirror's Edge Tweaker by softsoundd](https://www.moddb.com/games/mirrors-edge/addons/persistent-fov)
* [Mirror's Edge Multiplayer Mod](https://github.com/LucasOe/mmultiplayer/releases)

## Optional
* [Native Motion Blur](https://www.moddb.com/games/mirrors-edge/addons/native-motion-blur)
* [Rain Mod by keku](https://www.moddb.com/games/mirrors-edge/addons/rainy-mod)
* [ReShade](https://reshade.me)

## Installation
For the multiplayer mod, download `Launcher.exe` and `mmultiplayer.dll` and move them into your game directory. No need of the `mirrors-edge-multiplayer-2.3.2.exe` that is in fact the launcher and dll installer.
If you prefer that way you will find the launcher in your start menu. 
<p></p>
Download and extract the tweaker in your game directory. 

## Configuration
### Mirror's Edge Tweaks
Start `Mirror's Edge Tweaks` and the first thing to do is point to your game directory and choose `TdGame Fix` as your version if you care of being able to have a Cinematic Faith model. You will only have to do this once.

Apply the `Console` and `Mod` patches, install the `Cheats and trainer` and have your fps and PhysX fps capped at the same value. Very very very important for later.

For the Graphic Tweaks, it's up to you. Just one thing: do not set the anti aliasing to 16xQ! It's not supported anymore on NVIDIA cards. Your game won't start if you do so.

</div>
<div> </div>

Enable `HQ dynamic shadows` and set Texture management to `Modern` for a better and smooth texture display. Leave or change the LOD. Your choice.

</div>

Last, enable the Cinematic Faith model and you are done with the tweaks.

### Keybinds and Ultra Graphics
You will need to add some keybinds to take advantage of the Ultra Graphics and the availables cheats. For this, go to `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\Documents\EA Games\Mirror's Edge\TdGame\Config` and uncheck the `Read Only` flag first. Edit TdInput.ini and add these lines just underneath `[Engine.PlayerInput]`. Save the file and set the file back to `Read Only`.
```
Bindings=(Name="F1",Command="exec cheats",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)
Bindings=(Name="F1",Command="UltraGraphics",Control=True,Shift=False,Alt=False)
Bindings=(Name="F2",Command="set DOFEffect bAutoFocus 0 | set DOFEffect MaxFarBlurAmount 0",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)
Bindings=(Name="F3",Command="FreeFlightCamera",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)
Bindings=(Name="F4",Command="tdpause",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)
```
The `exec cheats` **MUST** be activated before being able to use the `UltraGraphics`. So, press F1 first, the level will reload and then press CTRL+F1 to activate the grpahic tweak.

### mmultiplayer
This mod is not "just" adding support for multiplayer. It's much more than that. You can by example disable part of the scene, disable the lighting, have track recording with nodes, etc.

## In Flight Screenshotting

You will need to use the `Dolly` option from `mmultiplayer` to accomplish this. Keep in mind that the count is made in frames and not in seconds. But here, it has not much importance. So, to do so, follow these steps:

### The Recording
* In the `mmultiplayer` interface enable the `Trainer` to have the flycam available. Using the `FreeFlightCam` won't work.
* Go to `Dolly` and add your first markup/node.
* Press `2` to activate the fly cam and move around. Press `Insert` to disable the `mmultiplayer` interface.
* Press `Insert` and set the nÂ° of frames at like 120 and add a new node/markup where you will land. Other buildaning or part of a building. Your choice.
* Once done, click on `Go To` on your first node/markup and press `2` to disable the flycam.
* Now Press `Start Recording` and follow the marked path.
* Open the `mmultiplaye` interface and press `Stop Recording`. Close the interface.

### Play the Recording
* Press `2` to activate the freecam and then `Insert` to display the interface.
* Uncheck `Display Path`.
* Press `Play` to start the recording and press `Insert` back to display the interface.
* Now, press `Stop` and move the cursor on the `Timeline`.
* Once you see Faith move frame per frame until you get your shot.
* Frame your shot, capture it and disable the free camera.
* Press `Play` to resume.

With this techique you will now be able to finally take shots of Faith in flight. 


## About Reshade
If you installed the `mmultiplayer` mod, and if reshade is installed, the gamee will not start correctly. For this, you will need to rename `d3d9.dll` to `dinput8.dll`.
You will then be able to use ReShade in conjunction with the multiplayer mod.
